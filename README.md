I do not own any rights to the Patapon franchise! It is fully owned by Sony! This is a quick fan project to test if patapon 4 (the next installation) would truly benefit from using 3D graphics instead of sticking to 2D



## Gameplay

The game fully operates like the original patapon game. You are Kamipon, a god which patapon's worship. Through the power of your drums you can put your loyal patapons
into a dancing frenzy, improving their battle potential!

How to play
Strike the drums in the correct 4 beat sequence to issue commands to your patapon army! Strike the drum in rhytm 9 times in a row to trigger fever mode! Fever mode makes some of your
commands stronger

Currently implemented commands:
PATA-PATA-PATA-PON = Move forward command
PON-PON-PATA-PON = Attack command

Controls (keyboard only sorry!)
A - PATA drum
X - PON drum
Z - DON drum
S - CHAKA drum
